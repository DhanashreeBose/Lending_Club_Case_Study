## General Information
- LendingClub is an online peer-to-peer lending platform that allows investors to lend money directly to individual borrowers, bypassing traditional banks and financial institutions. The company was founded in 2007 and has facilitated more than $50 billion in loans to date.

- The LendingClub case study typically involves analyzing a dataset of loan data from the platform in order to build a model that can predict whether a given loan will default or not. This involves cleaning and preprocessing the data, performing exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data, feature engineering to create new features from the existing ones, and then training and evaluating a machine learning model on the data.

- The goal of the case study is to build a model that can accurately predict loan defaults, which is important for both investors and the platform itself to manage risk and ensure profitability. The case study typically involves using techniques from supervised learning, such as logistic regression or decision trees, and evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Conclusions
- The people who have taken the loan in the month of the December are more likely to be in the list of defaulters
- The people who have taken the loan in the year of 2011 are more likely to be the defaulters 
-	In the month of the December there are many festivals which happens in the US so people are more likely to get the loans and are being charged off 
- The reason for the above case could be that the country could have the financial crisis
- The people who have the open accounts in the range of 2-10 are more likely to be the defaulters as the reason could be that they are unable to manage their finances
Since they need to maintain minimum balance in each of the accounts which leads not able to repay the loan 
- The people whose verification is not done and for whom the loan is approved without any background check are most likely to be defaulters so it is recommended not to approve the loan without any background check of the loan borrowers
- Try to avoid giving the loans to the people who belongs to grade B and D or do a good background check for them 
- The people who take the loan for debt consolidation purpose that is to clear other loans are more likely to be in the list of defaulters. It is recommended to avoid giving the loans for debt consolidation purpose.
